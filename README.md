Office365 add-in to send fake NDRs

I frequently receive commercial solicitations that look like (and sometimes actually are) sent by live salespeople. Often times these communications are very annoying and, what's even worse, they lack any automated unsubscribe option (which is a violation of CAN-SPAM act). To keep those individuals engaged and myself entertained I (in very close collaboration with StackOverflow) developed an Office365 add-in that sends a fake NDR (non-delivery report) to the sender of a selected message, then deletes the original message. You may find other use cases for such functionality.
